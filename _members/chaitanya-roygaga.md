Chaitanya Roygaga is a passionate computer vision researcher and current Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Lehigh University, working under the guidance of Dr. Aparna Bharati. His research centers on deep learning and facial analytics, where he advances models that predict subjective human attributes — such as trustworthiness — and develops semantic face editing methods that merge technical innovation with nuanced human perception.

Chaitanya thrives in collaborative and multidisciplinary teams. As a Multimodal AI Intern at Trivent Systems, he has contributed to the development and prototyping of medical AI products, focusing on the evaluation and deployment of algorithms that enhance real-world healthcare solutions. Previously, his work with Dr. Nathaniel Blanchard’s group at Colorado State University explored athlete performance evaluation and neural architecture search, tackling body pose estimation and resource optimization on hardware platforms.

Committed to supporting the academic community, Chaitanya has served as a teaching assistant for systems software, algorithms, and artificial intelligence courses, fostering learning environments that empower students to explore the intersections of theory and practice. His dedication has been recognized through academic awards including the Rossin College Fellowship at Lehigh University.

Chaitanya values curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning. Professionally and personally, he enjoys transforming ambitious ideas into impactful, user-centered technologies, and he takes pride in contributing to research teams where open discussion and creative problem-solving are encouraged.
