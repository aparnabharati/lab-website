Simon Chen is a first-year M.S. student in Data Science at Lehigh University and a member of the SeeVi Lab advised by Dr. Aparna Bharati. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and media forensics, with a current focus on style protection methods and traceability for AI-generated imagery.
Drawing on an undergraduate background in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics and professional experience at Adobe as a Technical Support Engineer (Target and Analytics), Simon is motivated by questions of trust, attribution, and responsible deployment of machine learning systems. He is particularly interested in connecting technical performance to real-world integrity and policy considerations.
At the National Institutes of Health, he also helped conduct experiments on CRISPR/Cas gene-editing projects in the Lab on Microbial Pathogenesis. He appreciates opportunities that challenge himself, to critically think through difficult problems and synthesize them into digestible, actionable insights.
Outside the lab, Simon serves as President of Lehighâ€™s Machine Learning Club for graduate students, organizing hands-on events that help peers build skills beyond the classroom. In his spare time, he enjoys writing, pickleball, and cooking. An avid photographer, he also loves to travel and document the everyday sights of life, whimsy, and wonder.
