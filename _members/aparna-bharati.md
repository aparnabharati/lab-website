I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Lehigh University with research interests in the areas of Media Forensics, Computer Vision, Biometrics, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. I serve as a member of the IEEE Information Forensics and Security Technical Committee, IEEE Biometric Council's Editorial Board and PAMI-TC and have served in the program committee of venues such as CVPR, AAAI, WACV, IJCB, FG and ICPR.  

Prior to coming to Lehigh, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame where I was a research assistant for DARPA's MediFor project led by Drs. Kevin Bowyer, Walter Scheirer and Patrick Flynn and a member of the Computer Vision Research Lab. As a Machine Learning Research Intern in the Document Intelligence Lab at Adobe Research, I worked on document change analysis with Drs. Rajiv Jain and Vlad Morariu during the summer of 2019. In 2015, I graduated from IIIT-Delhi with a B. Tech in Computer Science & Engineering and specialized in Image Analysis and Machine Intelligence. My undergraduate research was supervised by Drs. Mayank Vatsa and Richa Singh.
